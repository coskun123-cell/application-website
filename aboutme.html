        <p>
          I am a 41-year-old junior web developer candidate. I have an
          experience in working effectively as a part of a team, have
          self-discipline to achieve my goals, firmly believe that have a strong
          skill in Maths and analytical thinking due to my formal education. I
          was introduced to the idea of learning web developing by a close
          friend last summer. Through our conversations, I have become more and
          more interested and grown passion for web development and started
          learning it on online platforms by watching videos based on
          JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Now, I feel fully committed to learn web
          development and strongly believe that I will show great success in the
          sector if I am offered a training opportunity. I am looking for a
          suitable developer position with an exciting and innovative company
          that offers me this opportunity for my progress in Web Development.

                Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for
                documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
                assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and
                scripting languages such as JavaScript.

              <h1>CSS</h1>
              <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for
                describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
                language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the
                World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

              <h1>JAVASCRIPT</h1>
              <p>
                JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
                that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is
                high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It
                has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
                object-orientation, and first-class functions.
